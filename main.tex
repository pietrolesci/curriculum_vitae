\runsubsection{PhD Student @ University of Cambridge}
\location{October 2021 – present | Cambridge, UK}
I am working with Prof Andreas Vlachos on compute- and data-efficient approaches for NLP. Currently focusing on active learning for large and imbalanced datasets~\cite{lesci-vlachos} %\textit{(keywords: active learning, data subset selection, machine teaching, meta-learning)}

%data-centric approaches for adversarial robustness, generalization, and efficiency in NLP with applications in natural language inference and question answering/generation
%(\textit{keywords: active-learning, machine teaching, meta-learning})
%I am currently interested in parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (\textit{keywords: few-shot learning, meta-learning, active-learning})
%\item Themes: few-shots learning for Natural Language Processing via meta-learning and active learning
